## Farmer doesn't use all the slots ?

eg: I'm farming with spy probes, I have 20 slots, and the farmer only use 5-10 slots.  

it's not a matter of number of slots reserved  
it's a matter of how fast we allow the bot to be  
we have decided this is the best balance for something that looks human and won't get you banned.
