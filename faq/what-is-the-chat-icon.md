## What is the "chat active/inactive" icon ? 

The bot is able to intercept in-game messages when the icon is green.

The icon will become red when you use the built-in browser.  
For some technical reasons, when the browser is open, the bot cannot intercept messages.

The icon will become green again once you open another page outside the browser.  
You just have to make sure that the icon is green when you leave !.
