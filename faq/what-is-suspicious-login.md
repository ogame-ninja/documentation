## What is "suspicious login" ?
 
It means the bot need to login, and he doesn't know why.  
For example, if you log in on ogame website, it will disconnect the bot, and he will have to re-login.  
Or if you run the bot in two different locations, they will disconnect each other.

You can try to change your ogame password, and see if it fixes the issue.  
You will need to update the new password in the bot settings afterward.
