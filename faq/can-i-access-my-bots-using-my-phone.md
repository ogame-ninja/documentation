## Can I access my bots using my phone ?

Yes.

### Self-host

The easiest way is to activate the "Reverse tunnel" in the admin settings.  
Once activated, you will be able to access your application via `https://<username>.me.ogame.ninja`  

If you want to access your application using the machine IP address, you need to start the application with the `--host 0.0.0.0` flag.

### Cloud

Just use your phone browser.
