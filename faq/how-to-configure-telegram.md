## How to configure telegram

If you wish to use our Telegram notifier, you'll have to get your ID by messaging the word `/getid` to an account
named `@myidbot`, which will reply to you with your Telegram ID number.

After that, if you are a **cloud user**, simply send the word `/start` to the account named `@OGameAttackBot`
(there is no confirmation message, don't panic).

If you are a **self-host user**, you will have to set up your own telegram bot token, you can find out how to do that
by [clicking here](https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token) and putting your telegram bot
token ID in [http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/settings](http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/settings).
