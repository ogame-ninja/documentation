# Terms of service

The user agree to respect the license he bought. So if you paid a license for 2 bots,
you agree to only ever use two bots at a time with that license.  

If you feel like you can hack the software and use it for free, I reserve the right to fuck up your accounts.  
Hack at your own risks :)
