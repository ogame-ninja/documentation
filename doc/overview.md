# Bot overview

In the bot tab you will be able to see basic information about your account and universe, along with some buttons.

"Repatriate now" will transport resources from all your planets to the one you selected on the Defender tab.  

The "Check attacks" button will check for any incoming attacks when you press it,
for this button to work you will also need to activate the Defender plugin by ticking the "Defender active" checkbox.  

The "What's my IP?" button will pop up a message with the current IP that is being used by your account.
This is particularly useful if you are using a proxy and want to make sure the right IP is being used.
