# Scripts

Scripts are extremely powerful.  
You can control the bot in the way you want, make your own logic.  
You should be able to create mostly anything you can think of using the scripts.  
This tool allows you to access all the API & functions that powers NJA.  
You can find more documentation [on the scripting documentation](/doc/scripting).  
There is also a bunch of [example scripts on github](https://github.com/ogame-ninja/scripts).  
Feel free to ask for help on discord #scripts channel.
