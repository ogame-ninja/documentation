# Scripts

Scripts are extremely powerful.  
You can control the bot in the way you want, make your own logic.  
You should be able to create mostly anything you can think of using the scripts.  
This tool allows you to access all the API & functions that powers NJA.  
You can find more documentation [on the scripting documentation](/doc/scripting).  
There is also a bunch of [example scripts on github](https://scripts.ogame.ninja).  
Feel free to ask for help on discord #scripts channel.  

# Check script

The check script button allows you to validate that the syntax of a script is
right without having to actually run the script.

It will also tell you some notable functions that are used by the script.

If you took a script from someone else, you can quickly see if any suspicious
functions are used.
