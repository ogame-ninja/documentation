# Discovery

This tool will send "discovery fleet" (search for lifeform) in a range of systems around the chosen planets/moons.

"Max discovery slots" will limit the number of slots used for discoveries.  
If "leave open" is ticked, then it will use all slots except the number of slots selected in the slots dropdown.

"Systems range" is the limit of how far the bot will look around the selected planets/moons for possible discovery missions.
