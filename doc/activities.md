# Activities

On this page, you can see a graph of your activities. An activity occurs when a fleet is sent.  
You want to have this graph look like a normal human is playing.  
So if you usually sleep between 22h and 7h, you want the bot to also look like it is sleeping during this time.  


##### Bot logins
The graph also display when the bot login. These activities are represented with a half blue bar.
