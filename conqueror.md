To use this tool, you have to manually spy active players.  
Once this is done, you can click "Get spy reports" to import the reports from ogame into NJA.  
At this point, you will have an overview of all the players you spied, how many defences and resources they have, and you can make decisions on which target are the most valuable to you.  
You can now click on a target to open the spy report in the simulator.  
When you are happy with the result of the simulator, you can send the attack directly from the simulator interface.  
You can also use the ACS planer to schedule advanced attacks on a target.
